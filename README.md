# Notes

Stu Thompson's Awsome Technical Notes.

This is a collection of notes on a variety of topics. I add notes when I learn
new things to avoid potentially losing the knowledge and to add reference
information for my own use later.

## Structure

They aren't particularly organized or thought through. I've separated into
broad categories and have plans someday to annotate with tags for easier
searching. For now, they're just structured as I add them.
