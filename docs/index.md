# Overview

*Stu Thompson's Technical Notebook*

This site contains my notes on software, programming, and technology.

### Purpose

I use this as an online repository of information I want to remember. These
could be gists or playpens or a whole bunch of other discrete "host a note"
solutions. I prefer to have the pages in a single repository.

### Thanks & Good Luck

I hope you *(whoever you are)* derive value from this content, that I answered
a question for you, or inspired you to write notes of your own. If future me is
reading this, I hope the investment is worth it.

May these notes provide guidance, and if not guidance then a way to spend a
few minutes of your day.
